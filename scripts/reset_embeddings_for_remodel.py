"""Null stored embeddings after a same-dimension embedding-model swap.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
``episodes.embedding`` and ``facts.embedding`` are both ``VECTOR(768)``.
``nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5`` replaced ``snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1.5``
at the *same* dimension, which makes the swap completely invisible to every
guard the system has:

- ``core.embeddings.validate_embedding_dim`` only checks ``len(vec) == 768``
  — old vectors are 768-wide, so they pass;
- the ``VECTOR(768)`` CHECK constraints — same width, so they pass;
- ``CAST(:embedding AS vector(768))`` — same width, so it cannot reshape;
- the HNSW indexes — they keep serving, just over a stale vector space.

Left alone, every stored vector stays a valid 768-float vector that is
semantically meaningless against the new model. Retrieval degrades to noise
with no error anywhere. Recovery is only possible *before* the new vectors
are written, which is why this script refuses to run without ``--yes``.

WHAT IT DOES (and deliberately does not do)
-------------------------------------------
It only resets state; it never embeds. The backfill is already implemented
and battle-tested in ``workers/tasks/reconcile_enrichment.py``, which runs
as a 5-minute ARQ cron:

- **Episodes** — this script clears ``embedding`` and the
  ``ENRICHMENT_EMBEDDING`` bit (bit 1). ``embed_episode`` skips any episode
  whose bit is already set, so clearing it is what makes the row eligible
  again. Other enrichment bits are left untouched: only the embedding leg
  needs redoing, and re-running the LLM legs would cost money. Reconcile
  then enqueues ``embed_episode`` for those rows.
- **Facts** — this script sets ``embedding = NULL, embedded_at = NULL``.
  Reconcile's fact pass selects on exactly that pair (``embedding IS NULL
  AND embedded_at IS NULL AND invalid_at IS NULL``), which makes every
  fact eligible for re-enqueue as ``embed_fact``. Retracted facts
  (``invalid_at IS NOT NULL``) are skipped by that query and are therefore
  left untouched here too.

Both passes are throttled: reconcile handles 100 rows per tick, so expect
a visible ramp rather than an instant re-embed.

⚠️ The fact re-enqueue path also requires the ARQ worker to be running, and
the episode pass skips episodes in projects that are archived.

Usage:
    python scripts/reset_embeddings_for_remodel.py --dry-run
    python scripts/reset_embeddings_for_remodel.py --yes
